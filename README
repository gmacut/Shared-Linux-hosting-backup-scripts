This project consists of two bash scripts: backupRemote and backupLocal. They are meant to be used for automated backup of sites on shared Linux hosting where user typically has limited privileges.

Script backupRemote packs and compresses files and MySQL databases on remote server. It can be run manually, or using second script from our local machine.
Script backupLocal is able to connect to remote server using ssh with public-private key authentication and passprases. On established connection script executes backupRemote. Resulting backup package is then transferred to our local machine and stored to a safe place of our choosing.
